This repository demonstrates a common error in Perl programming: accessing an array element using an index that is out of bounds. The `bug.pl` file contains the erroneous code, which attempts to access the fourth element of a three-element array.  The `bugSolution.pl` file provides a corrected version that handles potential out-of-bounds access.
